# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application clone of Airbnb, built to simulate a real-world booking platform. The goal is to master collaborative development, backend architecture, database design, API security, and CI/CD pipeline implementation.

## Tech Stack
The project will utilize a modern tech stack including:
- **Backend:** Django & Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Query Language:** GraphQL
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean)

- ## Team Roles

In a project of this scale, team members assume specialized roles:

- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for building the core application logic, APIs (REST/GraphQL), and integrating with the database using Django.
- **Database Administrator (DBA):** Designs, implements, and maintains the PostgreSQL database schema. Ensures data integrity, optimizes queries, and handles migrations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Sets up and manages the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker. Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Security Specialist:** Implements authentication (JWT/OAuth), authorization, encryption, and other security best practices across the application.
- **Project Manager / Tech Lead:** Oversees the project timeline, coordinates tasks between team members, facilitates agile ceremonies (stand-ups, sprints), and ensures alignment with project goals.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:** Writes and executes manual and automated test plans to identify bugs and ensure the application meets functional requirements.
